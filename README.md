Simple token created using Algorand framework.

It is done in node.js using the Algorand SDK. Must be installed using npm

It uses the ASA feature of Algorand to create the cryptocoin (a cryptocoin and a token is the same)

It assigned tokens directly to accounts. In an actual application the mnemonic should be encripted, and the transferring methods should be done behind a REST API
